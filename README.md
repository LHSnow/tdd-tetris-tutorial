Javascript Tetris
===================

This Tetris implementation is a TypeScript port of @orfjackal's TDD tetris tutorial (in Java). 
It uses test names and implementation ideas from the tutorial, but is otherwise a complete rewrite to be run in a browser environment. 

Motivation
---

Sandboxing ideas for test driven websites to prove concepts used in my day to day work. 

Brief evolution

1. JQuery GUI was considered but never implemented
1. QUnit got replaced by Karma/Jasmine  
1. JavaScript implementation ported to TypeScript
1. Work on Angular GUI started
