Javascript Tetris
===================

This Tetris implementation is a Javascript/QUnit port of @orfjackal's TDD tetris tutorial (in Java). It uses test names and implementation ideas from the tutorial, but is otherwise a complete rewrite to be run in a browser environment. As the project progresses, it is highly likely to evolve into a jQuery plugin, possibly by using jQuerymobile components for GUI.

The project is intended for my personal enjoyment of programming while practicing some javascript.
